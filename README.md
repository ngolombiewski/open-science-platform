# OpenAlex Research Data Platform

Work in progress.

This capstone project for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2026 builds an end-to-end data pipeline on GCP that ingests research metadata from the OpenAlex API, stores raw and processed data in a data lake, models the data in BigQuery using dbt, and exposes insights via a dashboard.

Planned stack:
- GCP (GCS, BigQuery)
- Terraform (IaC)
- Dagster (orchestration)
- Spark (data processing)
- dbt (transformations)
